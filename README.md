# 🐍 Python Practice Toolkit

This is a simple Python project showcasing basic programming and numerical analysis techniques. It includes:

- 📆 **Age Calculator** – Computes age from a given date of birth  
- 🧮 **Numerical Differentiation** – Approximates derivatives of functions  
- ∫ **Numerical Integration** – Calculates definite integrals using numerical methods

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Age Calculator
- 📥 Input: Birthdate (`YYYY-MM-DD`)  
- 📤 Output: Age in years, months, and days  

### 2. Bisection Method
- Find the root of a function using the bisection method. 
- Inputs: Function (as string), interval `(a,b)`, and decimal places.

### 3. Divided differences and Interpolations
- Computes the divided differences a given set of data and use the result to compute the lagrange's interpolation polynomial.
- Inputs: Two lists of the values of xn for x and yn for y for the divided differences and lagrange's interpolation.

### 4. Numerical Integration
- Implements Trapezoidal and Simpson’s Rule  
- Inputs: Function (as string), limits `a` & `b`, and number of intervals `n`  

### 5. Lagrange's Polynomial
