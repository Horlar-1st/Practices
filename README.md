# 🐍 Python Practice Toolkit

This is a simple Python project showcasing basic programming and numerical analysis techniques. It includes:

- 📆 **Age Calculator** – Computes age from a given date of birth.
- **Bisection Method** - Solve for the root of non-linear equation.
- **Lagrange's Polynomial** - Computes the lagrange's polynomial of given sets of input.
- **Numerical Differentiation** – Approximates derivatives of functions.
- ∫ **Numerical Integration** – Calculates definite integrals using numerical methods.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Age Calculator
- 📥 Input: Birthdate (`DD, MM, YYYY`)  
- 📤 Output: Age in years, months, and days  

### 2. Bisection Method
- Find the root of a non-linear equation using the bisection method. 
- Inputs: Function (as string), interval `(a,b)`, and decimal places.

### 3. Divided differences and Interpolations
- Computes the divided differences a given set of data and use the result to compute the lagrange's interpolation polynomial.
- Inputs: Two lists of the values of xn for x and yn for y for the divided differences and lagrange's interpolation.

### 4. Lagrange's Polynomial
- Computes the lagrange's polynomial of given sets of input.
- Inputs: Two lists of the values of xn for x and yn for y.

### 5. Numerical Integration
- Implements Trapezoidal and Simpson’s Rule  
- Inputs: Function (as string), limits `a` & `b`, and number of intervals `n`  

### 6. My Practice
- This notebook contains several practices that serves as foundational build up for me.
- It varies from easy to expert across several sections.
